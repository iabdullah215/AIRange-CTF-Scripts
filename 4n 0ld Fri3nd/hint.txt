Back in my hometown, I had a friend named Muhammad Ali Shah. We haven't met since our childhoods, but I surely remember one incident vividly. One day, he received his attendance report, and we were laughing that he was absent
256 days out of 365 days and that one day he got hit by a car and got 64 bases of plaster over his hand. Now, he is lost somewhere in the wild. Before leaving for Karachi, we met for the last time, and he gave me an envelope
with this alphanumeric string in it. He said it would guide me to success in my difficulties of life. So, use it wisely when needed.
